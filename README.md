# Global Superstore Data Analysis Project 🌎📊

This project focuses on analyzing the **Global Superstore Dataset** to explore important business metrics such as **sales by region**, **profit margins** of items sold by category, **shipping costs**, and **order priority breakdown** across different countries. I performed data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation to extract valuable insights from the data. This analysis aims to help identify sales patterns, optimize business decisions, and predict future trends.

## Project Overview 🚀

In this project, the **Global Superstore Dataset** was analyzed using **Tableau** for creating interactive visualizations. The dataset was **cleaned**, **transformed**, and **manipulated** to set relationships between various data sources, and measures and dimensions were extracted for analysis. The focus was on sales performance, profit margins, shipping costs, and order priorities across multiple regions and countries.

The key metrics explored were:
- **Sales performance** across regions and countries
- **Profit margins** of items sold by category
- **Shipping costs** across different regions
- **order priorities of Breakdown** (High, Medium, Low, Critical)

## Techniques & Features Used 🛠️

- **Data Blending**: Combined multiple data sources into a single visualization.
- **Calculated Fields**: Used to calculate percentages, averages, and other derived metrics.
- **Dual-Axis Charts**: Compared two measures on the same chart for deeper insights.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allowed dynamic visualization updates based on user input.
- **Trend Lines & Forecasting**: Helped visualize trends over time and forecast future patterns.

### Key Visualizations Created 📈

#### 1. **Bar Chart - Sales by Region** 📊
A **bar chart** was created to visualize the sales performance by region across different countries. This helped to identify which regions were performing best in terms of sales.

- **Insights**: This bar chart highlights the top-performing regions based on total sales, helping to identify where efforts should be focused for maximum impact. 
- **Features Used**: Average, Mode, and Percentage calculations were applied to show the highest-performing regions.

#### 2. **Scatter Plot - Profit Margin by Category** 💸
A **scatter plot** was used to show the relationship between **profit margins** and **sales** across different item categories.

- **Insights**: This scatter plot revealed which categories had higher profit margins and where the sales performance could be optimized for better profitability.

#### 3. **Line Chart - Shipping Costs Over Time** 🚚
A **line chart** was used to visualize **shipping costs** over different years of order dates.

- **Insights**: The line chart helped in identifying trends in **shipping costs** and how they have evolved over time, offering insights into potential cost-saving measures or pricing changes.

#### 4. **Pie Chart - Order Priority Breakdown** 🍰
A **pie chart** was used to break down order priorities (High, Medium, Low, Critical) to provide a clear view of the distribution.

- **Insights**: The pie chart provided a clear understanding of how order priorities are distributed, which is crucial for logistics and resource management.

### Dashboard and Interactivity 🎛️

All the visualizations were integrated into a **single interactive dashboard**, allowing users to interact with the data dynamically. Filters applied to any worksheet automatically update the entire dashboard, providing real-time insights.

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filters were added to allow users to focus on specific data subsets (e.g., focusing on specific regions or categories).
- **Real-Time Updates**: As users applied filters, the entire dashboard updated accordingly, enabling detailed exploration of different aspects of the dataset.

### Additional Customization & Features 🌟

- **Calculated Fields**: Used to show dynamic data like percentages, averages, and sums, enhancing the insights extracted.
- **Interactive Legends**: Color, size, and opacity legends were used to highlight key trends and help in interpreting the data.
- **Tooltip Customization**: Custom tooltips provided additional context and insights when hovering over data points.

### Visualization Breakdown 📊

1. **Bar Chart - Sales by Region**: Helps identify the regions with the highest sales. The average and percentage functions were applied to provide a more detailed analysis of the sales figures.
2. **Scatter Plot - Profit Margin by Category**: Visualizes the relationship between profit margin and sales by category. It identifies profitable categories with high sales potential.
3. **Line Chart - Shipping Costs Over Time**: Tracks the trend in shipping costs, allowing insights into cost fluctuations and helping identify areas for optimization.
4. **Pie Chart - Order Priority Breakdown**: Breaks down orders by priority level, making it easier to identify high, medium, and low-priority orders for better resource allocation.

### Technologies Used 💻
- **Tableau**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Data Blending & Filtering**: Combined data from multiple sources and applied interactive filtering.
- **Trend Lines & Forecasting**: Used to predict future sales and analyze historical trends.

## Conclusion 🎯

This project provides valuable insights into the **Global Superstore Dataset**, helping stakeholders to better understand **sales patterns**, **profit margins**, **shipping costs**, and **order priorities**. The interactive dashboards built in **Tableau** allow users to explore the data dynamically, providing them with real-time insights to guide decision-making.
